# How did it all start?
 
October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:

The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[17] In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several documents to be collected into one block.

A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. The first blockchain was conceptualised by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008.

<p>
<i>A blockchain is a decentralized virtual ledger for recording transactions without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. It is made up of three technologies 

1. cryptographic algorithms, 
1. a distributed protocol, 
1. and replicated data 
<p>
which combined provide a trustworthy service to a group of nodes that do not fully trust each other. 
<p>
With blockchain, several users can write entries into a block or a record of information, and a community can control how the record of information is modified and updated.
</i>
Consensus protocol is pluggable, currently an implementation of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus using the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) protocol.
