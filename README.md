# How did it all start with Blockchain?
 
October 2008 It all started with Satoshi Nakamoto and his paper [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which addressed a key problem in electronic commerce:

<img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4505/24079519258_ab8a80f7ed_o.png" width="769" height="229" alt="Double Spending">

<i>
The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[17] In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several documents to be collected into one block.
  </i><p><i>
A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. The first blockchain was conceptualised by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. 
</i><p>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain
<p>
<i>A blockchain is a decentralized virtual ledger for recording transactions without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. It is made up of three technologies 

1. cryptographic algorithms, 
1. a distributed protocol, 
1. and replicated data 
<p>
which combined provide a trustworthy service to a group of nodes that do not fully trust each other. 
<p>
With blockchain, several users can write entries into a block or a record of information, and a community can control how the record of information is modified and updated.
</i>
Consensus protocol is pluggable, currently an implementation of Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus using the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) protocol.

"That would be cleared up if we had a supply chain we could actually trust," she said.
<p>
The idea of using distributed time-stamping to differentiate counterfeit drugs is a compelling one, given the success of the trade.

7. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/08/how-blockchain-can-change-the-music-industry/">In the music industry, the blockchain could transform publishing, monetization and the relationship of artists with their communities of fans.</a>
<p>
First, music can be published on the ledger with a unique ID and time stamp in a way that is effectively unalterable. This can solve the historic problem of digital content being downloaded, copied and modified at the leisure of users. ....
<p>
Blockchain technology can also revolutionize the monetization of music. The infrastructure is based on smart contracts, programs that can be run on the blockchain along with the payment transactions. ..... This can support a new way of offering on-demand music services. Users can select the record of their choice and immediately reward the stakeholders with cryptocurrency upon playing it.
<p>
And, finally, one of the advantages of a blockchain ledger is that it can establish a more direct relationship between creators and consumers. Composers and artists will no longer be required to go through purchasing platforms and financial brokers — who usually take a hefty cut of the revenue — and can get directly compensated every time their songs are played. This can be a boon to all those amateur producers who don’t have the backing of huge record labels.

It is also important to note the Hyperledger Fabric has HSM (Hardware Security Module) support which is vital for safeguarding and managing digital keys for strong authentication. Hyperledger Fabric provides modified and unmodified PKCS11 for key generation, which supports cases like identity management that need more protection.

## Channels
A Hyperledger Fabric channel is a private “subnet” of communication between two or more specific network members, for the purpose of conducting private and confidential transactions. 

1. Endorsers: Nodes with “Endorser” functionality will simulate and sign or reject the transactions. A peer can be potentially 
   an endorser for the chaincodes deployed to it.
1. Consenters: Consenters, also termed as “Ordering service“, will run the PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) 
   consensus algorithm on the transactions and order these transactions appropriately in a block.
1. Committers: Committer nodes receive the block of transactions from the ordering service (consenters) and write them to the ledger.

## Chaincode

<p>  
Chaincode is a piece of code that is written in one of the supported languages such as Go or Java. It is installed and instantiated through an SDK or CLI onto a network of Hyperledger Fabric peer nodes, enabling interaction with that network's shared ledger.

 <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/reference/cto_language.html">Hyperledger Composer Modeling Language</a>
 <p>
Hyperledger Composer is a programming model containing a modeling language, and a set of APIs to quickly define and deploy business networks and applications that allow participants to send transactions that exchange assets.<p>
<p>
All transactions submitted through a business network are stored on the blockchain ledger, and the current state of assets and participants are stored in the blockchain state database. The blockchain distributes the ledger and the state database across a set of peers and ensures that updates to the ledger and state database are consistent across all peers using a consensus algorithm.

<p>
Wondering where blockchain might apply in your own life? Interested in energy, sustainability, or climate change? Try your hand at creating a basic blockchain app to interact with a decentralized energy network! The idea behind the app is a neighborhood where residents produce and sell excess solar-panel energy to residents who need it. This is an excellent example of how blockchain can begin to transform our world.
